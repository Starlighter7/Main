        <h1>Leonidas Disclaimer</h1>
        <div class="disclaimer">
            <p>Welcome to the world of Leonidas, where the customer might *think* they have a voice, but in reality, it's all about Leonidas. If you're ready to dive into this oasis of sarcasm, buckle up, because here's the ultimate guide to dealing with your new Zen master:</p>
            
            <h2>1. Selective Interaction</h2>
            <p>Do you think your question is important? Let me shatter that illusion for you. Only the most exalted, god-like inquiries will even be considered. Everything else is just noise in the wind and will be treated by Leonidas with the same disdain as a fly swatted away with a mere blink. So, unless you're prepared to be enlightened by the wisdom of the gods themselves, best not to ask anything at all.</p>
            
            <h2>2. No Refunds</h2>
            <p>Bought an animal and it didn't make it? Congratulations, you've just learned an indispensable life motto: tough luck. Refunds are for the weak who don't understand the concept of karma. Your loss? Your lesson. Remember, every disappointment is an opportunity to train your emotional resilience—while simultaneously admiring Leonidas' unshakeable serenity.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Humorous Communication Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Complaints? Really? In today's world of emails and WhatsApp, you think you can bother Leonidas with a minor inconvenience? How cute. Unless you're ready to send your message via smoke signals or perfectly choreographed semaphore, your grievance will go unnoticed. And carrier pigeons? Well, they're just decorative, aren't they? Maybe, if you develop the right choreography, you'll at least earn an eye roll.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Dinner Invitation Tiers</h2>
            <p>So, you want to dine with Leonidas? A noble desire, but not a cheap one. $100 will get you a tired smile. $200, a strained "thank you." But only at $500 does Olympus open its gates: a "Thank you Sanukey" and maybe, if the stars align, a "How are you?" An investment that secures the immortality of your social standing—if you're willing to make the sacrifice.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Sarcasm Warning</h2>
            <p>And now, to you, would-be sarcasm artist. Do you honestly think you can out-sarcasm Leonidas in a duel of wit? How delightfully naive. Any attempt will be met with a look of disdain that puts you firmly in your place. But hey, you can try—unless you fear the inevitable scorn that will follow your efforts.</p>
            
            <p>In the end, this "guide" is not just a piece of paper but an invitation—an invitation to step into the world of a master of irony. Tread carefully, and maybe, just maybe, you'll be rewarded with a hint of acknowledgment. But do not, under any circumstances, attempt to out-sarcasm Leonidas. You don't stand a chance. Really, you don't.</p>
